# I2C  
Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) is a multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended, serial communication bus. It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers.  
This is a simple implementation of both I2C Master and I2C Slave modules in Verilog.  

## Features
* Single master implementation
* Supports multiple slave devices
* 7-bit addressing
* 8-bit data transfer
* 400KHz serial clock line

## Tools
* Verilog compiler (such as Icarus Verilog)
* Simulator (such as Modelsim)
